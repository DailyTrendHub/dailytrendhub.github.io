Why Delhi's artificial rain plan is on hold despite post-Diwali pollution spike
Delhi's much-awaited artificial rain experiment is still on hold months after initially being proposed. The trial, which was expected to take place after Diwali, hasn't received the green light yet.

The Delhi government had proposed the artificial rain experiment in July this year as one of the measures to tackle air pollution.
What minister said on Delhi artificial rain

Delhi environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa told news agency PTI that there were no suitable clouds for the trial according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), and no window is expected until October 25.

"The day we get suitable clouds, we will conduct the trial immediately, as all preparations — from permissions to flight arrangements — are already in place," he said.
